# Dingerz!

##A work-in-progress React front-end for a baseball scoring application

### TODO:
- fix Manage* loading bug
- go back and type all the stuff that's typed any
- re-enable links in list item classes
- change player detail form to use Player instead of separate rosterposition and person
- re-enable styling on button, possibly elsewhere (ManagementList)
- fix styling on LoadingProgressIndicator
- strongly type functions (probably with arrow functions?)
- get rid of linting warnings
